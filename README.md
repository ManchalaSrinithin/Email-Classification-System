## CSV File Guidelines

### Format

- **File Type**: CSV

### Columns

The CSV file should include the following columns:

- **email**: The email address of the sender.
- **subject**: The subject line of the email.
- **body**: The body content of the email.

### Example

Hereâ€™s an example of the required CSV format:

```csv
email                     subject                    body
example1@gmail.com    Meeting Request    Please schedule a meeting for next week.
example2@gmail.com    Job Application    Attached is my resume for the open position.
example3@gmail.com    HR Query           Can you provide more details about the company policies?
```

### Guidelines

- **Headers**: Ensure that the CSV file contains the headers `email`, `subject`, and `body` in the first row (case-sensitive).
- **Data Accuracy**: Make sure that the data in the columns is accurate and relevant.
- **File Size**: There might be limits on the file size. Ensure that the CSV file is within acceptable limits for upload.
